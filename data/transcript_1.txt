DAUGHTER: Mom, tell the doctor, like you told me.

DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thompson? Can you tell me what's wrong?

DOCTOR: And when was last time, can you remind me?

PATIENT: Oh, um...when was it, honey?

DAUGHTER: Don't you remember, Mom? After your, uh, spin class thing?

PATIENT: No, no, that was different. That was my legs. My legs hurt, remember? After that, exercise class. This is... it's more of a pressure. In my right side.

DOCTOR: Okay. Your right side. And it feels like pressure?

PATIENT: Yes, like a... like a heavy... When I bend over, mostly. Like in my garden. Gardening, you know.

DAUGHTER: She's been doing a lot in her garden lately.

NURSE: (Entering) Doctor, I have her chart here. Ms. Thompson, I see you were here three months ago. It says here that was during the bake sale. At your church?

PATIENT: Oh, yes. But that time it was... I was dizzy. Not pain. This is pain.

DOCTOR: I see a similar complaint here in February.

PATIENT: February? Oh, right... Yeah, I remember that day. It was cold, wasn't it? Cold that day. Actually I had some nausea that day. Too. Some nausea, in february.

DOCTOR: Okay. Are you on any new medications, Ms. Thompson?

PATIENT: Um... I've been taking that, uh... that yellow pill. You know, the one the doctor, at my clinic? Gave me. For my levels.

DOCTOR: Your levels?

PATIENT: You know, to keep them... even.

DAUGHTER: It's the one, um, your primary doctor said? To keep your numbers steady, Mom?

DOCTOR: Okay, so a yellow pill for your numbers. Do you know what your numbers were, that they were trying to keep steady?

PATIENT: No, not exactly. Just... numbers.

DOCTOR: Alright. And this pain, or pressure, is it constant?

PATIENT: No, not all the time. It comes and goes. Like a twinge. Sometimes a heavy twinge, you know?

DOCTOR: Does anything make it better or worse?

PATIENT: Well, like I said, when I bend. When I lean forward. It's worse. Like at work I sit all day so I don't notice it so much. It is worse when I stand or bend.

DAUGHTER: (On phone) ...I don't know, she says it's like a pressure... Yeah, she's at the hospital now... (To Patient) Mom, it's Cousin Carol. She wants to know if you've been avoiding the salty foods? Like the doctor said?

PATIENT: Oh, yes. Since last month. No more, um... what is it? No more of those salty chips.

DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thompson. Nurse, can you get a full set of vitals, and can we get an EKG and some blood work? We'll want to check those levels. And let's get an abdominal series as well.

NURSE: Sure thing, doctor.

DOCTOR: So you said the pain is worse with bending. Any other movements that make it worse?

PATIENT: Hmm, not really. Just, you know, when I'm active.

DAUGHTER: Mom, you forgot to tell him about the bloating!

PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Sometimes I feel a little, uh, full. Bloated, like she said.

DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any changes in your bowel movements?

PATIENT: No, not really. Regular, you know.

DAUGHTER: She did have some diarrea... diarr... loose stools a couple days ago.

PATIENT: Just once! That was just the once. I think it was something I ate.

DOCTOR: Okay. We'll get those tests, Ms. Thompson, and we'll see what they show. It could be a number of things. We'll try to get to the bottom of it.

DAUGHTER: She gets really bad heartburn too, doctor.

PATIENT: That's just sometimes, it's not related.

DOCTOR: Heartburn, okay. We'll take that into account as well.

NURSE: Vitals are... blood pressure 150 over 90. Heart rate 92. Resper... resp... breathing is 18. Temperature 98.9.

DOCTOR: Okay, thanks. Ms. Thompson we're going to run those tests, and I'll be back to check on you as soon as we have some results.

PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.

DAUGHTER: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We're just gonna try and figure out what's causing this okay?
