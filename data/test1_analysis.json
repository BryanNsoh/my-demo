  "transcript": "Dr. Ramirez: Good morning, Ms. Lee. It\u2019s been a while since we last spoke. How are you feeling today?\n\nMs. Lee: Morning, Doctor. I\u2019m\u2026 not sure how to answer that. I\u2019ve been tired. Not just physically, but sort of\u2026 heavy. And not sleeping well. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not making sense.\n\nDr. Ramirez: It\u2019s okay, take your time. When you say \u201cheavy,\u201d do you mean feeling low in mood, or more physically weighed down?\n\nMs. Lee: More\u2026 emotionally heavy. Like I wake up and I just want to stay in bed. I\u2019m not sad all the time, but I just don\u2019t feel like doing anything. \u6211\u6709\u70b9\u61d2, I guess \u201clazy,\u201d but it\u2019s not that I want to be lazy, I just have no energy.\n\nDr. Ramirez: You mentioned last time that work was stressful. Has that changed at all?\n\nMs. Lee: Work is still stressful. My boss is demanding, and I\u2019m behind on projects. I tried to cut back on hours like you suggested, but that didn\u2019t work out. If anything, I\u2019m doing more overtime now.\n\nDr. Ramirez: So the demands have increased. How\u2019s your sleep? You said not sleeping well\u2014what does that look like?\n\nMs. Lee: I fall asleep late, maybe around midnight or 1 am, and wake up at 5 feeling unrested. I toss and turn. Sometimes I wake up feeling like I have no reason to get up, but I have to, because of work.\n\nDr. Ramirez: Are you still taking the medication we started a few months ago, that small blue tablet for anxiety? It was a low-dose SSRI.\n\nMs. Lee: I took it for a while, but I stopped a few weeks ago. I wasn\u2019t sure it was helping. I felt maybe it made me gain weight, and I was worried about that. Also, I ran out and never refilled it.\n\nDr. Ramirez: You didn\u2019t call for a refill. It\u2019s important to let me know. Stopping abruptly can cause withdrawal or a return of symptoms. Have you noticed feeling worse since stopping?\n\nMs. Lee: Actually, yes. I felt more anxious the past two weeks, and the heavy feeling got stronger. I just didn\u2019t realize it could be connected.\n\nDr. Ramirez: It might be. Also, have you kept up any of the lifestyle changes we discussed\u2014like the short evening walks or calling a friend once a week?\n\nMs. Lee: No, I\u2019ve been skipping walks. And calling my friend\u2014I tried once, but she was busy. I haven\u2019t tried again. \u751f\u6d3b\u5f88\u5fd9, I feel life is too busy for those things.\n\nDr. Ramirez: I understand life gets busy, but these coping strategies are part of getting better. Let\u2019s talk about the physical symptoms: any changes in appetite, headaches, or stomach issues?\n\nMs. Lee: Appetite is strange. I\u2019m not hungry, but I force myself to eat something. I guess I\u2019ve been eating more sugary snacks, like those biscuits and bubble tea, just to feel something nice. Headaches, yes, mild ones in the afternoon.\n\nDr. Ramirez: More sugar can temporarily boost mood, but then you crash. It might affect your weight too, which you\u2019re concerned about. Have you been able to maintain a steady weight?\n\nMs. Lee: I think I gained a few pounds. My clothes feel tighter. That makes me more upset. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a loop: stressed at work, no energy, no healthy habits, then I feel worse.\n\nDr. Ramirez: We need to consider reintroducing the medication or trying a different approach. Maybe a different antidepressant, or start therapy. Also, any recent changes in family life?\n\nMs. Lee: My parents visited last month. They worry about me, tell me I\u2019m \u201c\u592a\u7d2f\u201d (too tired), and I feel guilty I can\u2019t show them I\u2019m doing well. That made me feel worse after they left.\n\nDr. Ramirez: Cultural expectations can add pressure. Have you noticed times when you do feel a bit lighter? Maybe weekends?\n\nMs. Lee: A little on Sunday afternoons when I get two hours to watch a movie. But then I think about Monday and it all comes back.\n\nDr. Ramirez: That suggests environment is a big factor. Let\u2019s try a structured plan: I recommend restarting an SSRI, but maybe a different one with less chance of weight gain. Also, can we try sleep hygiene steps\u2014like no screens an hour before bed?\n\nMs. Lee: I can try. No phone before bed, okay. And what about therapy? You mentioned it before, but I never followed up.\n\nDr. Ramirez: Yes, I can refer you to a counselor who understands cultural stressors. It might help to talk these feelings out. Also, consider journaling. Note times you feel low and what triggered it.\n\nMs. Lee: I\u2019ll try journaling. It\u2019s just so hard to start anything new.\n\nDr. Ramirez: Start small. Five minutes a day. Also, I\u2019ll prescribe a new medication\u2014let\u2019s try a low-dose sertraline. Take it daily, and I\u2019ll follow up in a month. If any side effects, call me. Don\u2019t just stop.\n\nMs. Lee: Okay, I\u2019ll do that. I want to feel better. I\u2019m tired of feeling this way.\n\nDr. Ramirez: We\u2019ll work through this together. Remember: small steps, consistent medication, and we\u2019ll reassess. It might take a few weeks to feel a difference, but let\u2019s commit.\n\nMs. Lee: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help."
