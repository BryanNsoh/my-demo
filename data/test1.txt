Dr. Ramirez: Good morning, Ms. Lee. It’s been a while since we last spoke. How are you feeling today?

Ms. Lee: Morning, Doctor. I’m… not sure how to answer that. I’ve been tired. Not just physically, but sort of… heavy. And not sleeping well. I’m sorry if I’m not making sense.

Dr. Ramirez: It’s okay, take your time. When you say “heavy,” do you mean feeling low in mood, or more physically weighed down?

Ms. Lee: More… emotionally heavy. Like I wake up and I just want to stay in bed. I’m not sad all the time, but I just don’t feel like doing anything. 我有点懒, I guess “lazy,” but it’s not that I want to be lazy, I just have no energy.

Dr. Ramirez: You mentioned last time that work was stressful. Has that changed at all?

Ms. Lee: Work is still stressful. My boss is demanding, and I’m behind on projects. I tried to cut back on hours like you suggested, but that didn’t work out. If anything, I’m doing more overtime now.

Dr. Ramirez: So the demands have increased. How’s your sleep? You said not sleeping well—what does that look like?

Ms. Lee: I fall asleep late, maybe around midnight or 1 am, and wake up at 5 feeling unrested. I toss and turn. Sometimes I wake up feeling like I have no reason to get up, but I have to, because of work.

Dr. Ramirez: Are you still taking the medication we started a few months ago, that small blue tablet for anxiety? It was a low-dose SSRI.

Ms. Lee: I took it for a while, but I stopped a few weeks ago. I wasn’t sure it was helping. I felt maybe it made me gain weight, and I was worried about that. Also, I ran out and never refilled it.

Dr. Ramirez: You didn’t call for a refill. It’s important to let me know. Stopping abruptly can cause withdrawal or a return of symptoms. Have you noticed feeling worse since stopping?

Ms. Lee: Actually, yes. I felt more anxious the past two weeks, and the heavy feeling got stronger. I just didn’t realize it could be connected.

Dr. Ramirez: It might be. Also, have you kept up any of the lifestyle changes we discussed—like the short evening walks or calling a friend once a week?

Ms. Lee: No, I’ve been skipping walks. And calling my friend—I tried once, but she was busy. I haven’t tried again. 生活很忙, I feel life is too busy for those things.

Dr. Ramirez: I understand life gets busy, but these coping strategies are part of getting better. Let’s talk about the physical symptoms: any changes in appetite, headaches, or stomach issues?

Ms. Lee: Appetite is strange. I’m not hungry, but I force myself to eat something. I guess I’ve been eating more sugary snacks, like those biscuits and bubble tea, just to feel something nice. Headaches, yes, mild ones in the afternoon.

Dr. Ramirez: More sugar can temporarily boost mood, but then you crash. It might affect your weight too, which you’re concerned about. Have you been able to maintain a steady weight?

Ms. Lee: I think I gained a few pounds. My clothes feel tighter. That makes me more upset. It’s like I’m in a loop: stressed at work, no energy, no healthy habits, then I feel worse.

Dr. Ramirez: We need to consider reintroducing the medication or trying a different approach. Maybe a different antidepressant, or start therapy. Also, any recent changes in family life?

Ms. Lee: My parents visited last month. They worry about me, tell me I’m “太累” (too tired), and I feel guilty I can’t show them I’m doing well. That made me feel worse after they left.

Dr. Ramirez: Cultural expectations can add pressure. Have you noticed times when you do feel a bit lighter? Maybe weekends?

Ms. Lee: A little on Sunday afternoons when I get two hours to watch a movie. But then I think about Monday and it all comes back.

Dr. Ramirez: That suggests environment is a big factor. Let’s try a structured plan: I recommend restarting an SSRI, but maybe a different one with less chance of weight gain. Also, can we try sleep hygiene steps—like no screens an hour before bed?

Ms. Lee: I can try. No phone before bed, okay. And what about therapy? You mentioned it before, but I never followed up.

Dr. Ramirez: Yes, I can refer you to a counselor who understands cultural stressors. It might help to talk these feelings out. Also, consider journaling. Note times you feel low and what triggered it.

Ms. Lee: I’ll try journaling. It’s just so hard to start anything new.

Dr. Ramirez: Start small. Five minutes a day. Also, I’ll prescribe a new medication—let’s try a low-dose sertraline. Take it daily, and I’ll follow up in a month. If any side effects, call me. Don’t just stop.

Ms. Lee: Okay, I’ll do that. I want to feel better. I’m tired of feeling this way.

Dr. Ramirez: We’ll work through this together. Remember: small steps, consistent medication, and we’ll reassess. It might take a few weeks to feel a difference, but let’s commit.

Ms. Lee: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
