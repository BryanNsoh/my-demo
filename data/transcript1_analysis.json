  "transcript": "Transcript:\n\n\n\n(Sounds of beeping monitors, muffled voices, a PA announcement about a code blue in room 3)\n\n\n\nPATIENT (Ms. Thompson): ...hurts...acting up again...\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: Mom, tell the doctor, like you told me.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thompson? Can you tell me what's wrong?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: My side...it's, uh, it started, like last time. Just like last time.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: And when was last time, can you remind me?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Oh, um...when was it, honey?\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: Don't you remember, Mom? After your, uh, spin class thing?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: No, no, that was different. That was my legs. My legs hurt, remember? After that, exercise class. This is... it's more of a pressure. In my right side.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay. Your right side. And it feels like pressure?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Yes, like a... like a heavy... When I bend over, mostly. Like in my garden. Gardening, you know.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: She's been doing a lot in her garden lately.\n\n\n\nNURSE: (Entering) Doctor, I have her chart here. Ms. Thompson, I see you were here three months ago. It says here that was during the bake sale. At your church?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Oh, yes. But that time it was... I was dizzy. Not pain. This is pain.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: I see a similar complaint here in February.\n\n\n\nPATIENT: February? Oh, right... Yeah, I remember that day. It was cold, wasn't it? Cold that day. Actually I had some nausea that day. Too. Some nausea, in february.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay. Are you on any new medications, Ms. Thompson?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Um... I've been taking that, uh... that yellow pill. You know, the one the doctor, at my clinic? Gave me. For my levels.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Your levels?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: You know, to keep them... even.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: It's the one, um, your primary doctor said? To keep your numbers steady, Mom?\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay, so a yellow pill for your numbers. Do you know what your numbers were, that they were trying to keep steady?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: No, not exactly. Just... numbers.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Alright. And this pain, or pressure, is it constant?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: No, not all the time. It comes and goes. Like a twinge. Sometimes a heavy twinge, you know?\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Does anything make it better or worse?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Well, like I said, when I bend. When I lean forward. It's worse. Like at work I sit all day so I don't notice it so much. It is worse when I stand or bend.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: (On phone) ...I don't know, she says it's like a pressure... Yeah, she's at the hospital now... (To Patient) Mom, it's Cousin Carol. She wants to know if you've been avoiding the salty foods? Like the doctor said?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Oh, yes. Since last month. No more, um... what is it? No more of those salty chips.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thompson. Nurse, can you get a full set of vitals, and can we get an EKG and some blood work? We'll want to check those levels. And let's get an abdominal series as well.\n\n\n\nNURSE: Sure thing, doctor.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: So you said the pain is worse with bending. Any other movements that make it worse?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Hmm, not really. Just, you know, when I'm active.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: Mom, you forgot to tell him about the bloating!\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Oh, yeah. Sometimes I feel a little, uh, full. Bloated, like she said.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any changes in your bowel movements?\n\n\n\nPATIENT: No, not really. Regular, you know.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: She did have some diarrea... diarr... loose stools a couple days ago.\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Just once! That was just the once. I think it was something I ate.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay. We'll get those tests, Ms. Thompson, and we'll see what they show. It could be a number of things. We'll try to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: She gets really bad heartburn too, doctor.\n\n\n\nPATIENT: That's just sometimes, it's not related.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Heartburn, okay. We'll take that into account as well.\n\n\n\nNURSE: Vitals are... blood pressure 150 over 90. Heart rate 92. Resper... resp... breathing is 18. Temperature 98.9.\n\n\n\nDOCTOR: Okay, thanks. Ms. Thompson we're going to run those tests, and I'll be back to check on you as soon as we have some results.\n\n\n\n(Sounds of machines beeping, more muffled voices)\n\nPATIENT: Okay. Thank you.\n\n\n\nDAUGHTER: Thank you, Doctor.\n\nDOCTOR: We're just gonna try and figure out what's causing this okay?\n\nPATIENT: okay.\n\n\n\n(End of Transcript Segment)"
